# Exploring New Features in EF Core 8  

EF Core 8 introduces features that enhance performance, flexibility, and developer productivity. This guide highlights key features with descriptions and examples.  


## Prerequisites  
To use EF Core 8, ensure you have the following:  
- .NET 8 SDK  
- EF Core 8 NuGet Package  

## Key Features  

### 1. Complex Types  
EF Core 8 simplifies the use of **complex types**, which group related properties into reusable structures.  
- These act as lightweight, embedded value objects, improving code organization and avoiding redundancy.  
- Example: A `Price` object can hold `Currency` and `Amount` properties, embedded in an entity like `Product`.  
- This design avoids additional database tables while ensuring data integrity.

### 2. Primitive Collections  
Enhancements to **primitive collections** enable efficient storage and retrieval of collections of simple data types, such as integers or strings.  
- Use Case: Associating a list of product IDs with an order becomes easier, simplifying schema design and improving query performance.  

### 3. JSON Column Enhancements  
EF Core 8 expands **JSON column** capabilities, allowing hierarchical or dynamic data storage in relational databases.  
- Store nested objects, like user attributes, in a single column and manipulate them efficiently.  
- This flexibility caters to modern, semi-structured data requirements.  

### 4. Hierarchy IDs  
**Hierarchy IDs** streamline the modeling of tree-structured data, such as organizational charts.  
- Integrated with SQL Server's native hierarchy operations.  
- Enables efficient queries for descendants, ancestors, and relationships.  

### 5. Raw SQL for Unmapped Types  
Developers can execute raw SQL queries and map the results to **unmapped types**.  
- Use Case: Handle temporary data structures or scenarios requiring custom SQL queries without tightly coupling them to the EF model.  

### 6. Lazy Loading Enhancements  
Improvements to **lazy loading** optimize performance and enable it by default for no-tracking queries.  
- Fine-tune lazy loading behavior to ensure efficient retrieval of related entities without redundant queries.  

### 7. Sentinel Values  
**Sentinel values** help distinguish uninitialized properties from valid data.  
- Example: Useful for managing default values and immutable fields like creation timestamps.  
- Ensures certain properties remain unchanged after their initial assignment.  

### 8. Bulk Operations: ExecuteUpdate and ExecuteDelete  
EF Core 8 simplifies bulk updates and deletions with the **ExecuteUpdate** and **ExecuteDelete** methods.  
- Enhanced performance for large datasets.  
- Support for updates involving multiple entity types, as long as they affect a single table.  

## Conclusion  
EF Core 8 builds upon its predecessors with a robust set of tools tailored for modern application development.  
- From handling complex and hierarchical data to optimizing bulk operations, it empowers developers to tackle diverse data scenarios efficiently.  
- Fully compatible with .NET 8, EF Core 8 ensures developers can build high-performance, scalable applications with greater ease and flexibility.  

Happy coding! ðŸš€
